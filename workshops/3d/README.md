# 3D Modelling'n'Printing

This workshop contains from two big parts:

## Modelling

> 3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical representation of
> any three-dimensional surface of an object (either inanimate or living)
> via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be
> displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering
> or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. (c) Wikipedia

## Printing

> 3D printing or additive manufacturing is any of various processes for making
> a three-dimensional object of almost any shape from a 3D model or other
> electronic data source primarily through additive processes in which
> successive layers of material are laid down under computer control.[2] A 3D
> printer is a type of industrial robot. (c) Wikipedia
